# LinkedinPdfToJson

This library takes in a LinkedIn Profile PDF and parses it into JSON.



## Special Shout Out

I wasn't sure where to start, but I found [linkedin-pdf-to-json](https://github.com/isaacmast/linkedin-pdf-to-json) written in JavaScript.  I needed it in elixir.  The project convinced me it was possible and gave me a map of where to start.
